The Questionnaire (Q) resource consists of 2 main parts:
* Information about the Q - url, name, purpose etc
* The form contents

Form contents are represented by nested item elements, each of which describes a single question to be displayed to a user (although the form contents can be dynamic with questions hidden and shown in response to user input and other factors).

There is no limit to the level of nesting in the base resource, but this IG limits the nesting to 2 levels in the interest of simplicity. This may be reviewed in future releases.
